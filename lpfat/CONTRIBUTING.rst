Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up lpfat for local development.

1. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone https://gitlab.core-services.leaseplan.systems/terraform/0072-wkl-lpbr-apps/lpfat

2. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

3. Develop locally while linting, testing and building

    $ _lint
    $ _test
    $ _build

4. Commit your changes and push your branch to the server::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

5. Submit a merge request
